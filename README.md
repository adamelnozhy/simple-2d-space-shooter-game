## AI Task: Complete README Transformation

Hello Cursor AI! Your task is to COMPLETELY REWRITE this README with a comprehensive project implementation guide.

### Critical Requirements:

1. **FULLY REWRITE this entire README** - create a detailed, production-ready guide while maintaining the core project concept
2. **Create a DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP PLAN (max 8 steps)** that covers:
   - Environment setup with all required technologies
   - Project structure creation
   - Implementation of core features
   - Testing and deployment approaches
3. **Tailor content to the user's profile:**
   - User's Experience Level: `Beginner`
   - User's Available Time: `A Few Hours`
4. **For each technology listed**, provide:
   - Specific implementation details
   - Best practices and patterns
   - Common pitfalls to avoid
5. **Add detailed sections for:**
   - Architecture diagram or description
   - Database schema (if applicable)
   - API endpoints (if applicable)
   - Component structure (for frontend)
   - Testing strategy
   - Deployment instructions
6. **Provide code examples** for critical project parts
7. **REMOVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS COMPLETELY** after your rewrite

Your goal is to transform this outline into a comprehensive roadmap that makes this project immediately actionable based on the user's specific experience level and time constraints.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FIRST STEP ‚ö†Ô∏è

**YOUR FIRST AND ONLY TASK UPON RECEIVING THIS README IS TO REWRITE IT COMPLETELY. DO NOT START IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT OR WRITING ANY CODE YET.**

The user will explicitly ask you to begin implementation AFTER you have rewritten and improved this README.

# Simple 2D Space Shooter Game

## Project Overview
Create a simple 2D space shooter game where a player controls a spaceship and shoots enemies. The game will have a basic level design, scorekeeping, and a game over screen. This project is perfect for beginners who want to learn the basics of game development.


> **üí° Quick Start:** After cloning this repository and opening it in Cursor, simply tell the AI: "Read the README and guide me through implementing this project step by step." Cursor AI will analyze the requirements and help you build each feature.


## User Profile
- **Experience Level:** Beginner
- **Available Time to Complete:** A Few Hours

## Technologies
- **Phaser**: A popular open-source framework for creating HTML5 games. It provides a lot of features out of the box, such as physics, animation, and input handling.
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used to create the game logic, handle user input, and update the game state.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used to create the game's UI, layout, and styling. HTML will be used to structure the game's UI, while CSS will be used to style it.


## Development Steps
### 1. Setup Phaser and Project Structure
Create a new Phaser project, set up the project structure, and create the necessary files for the game.

### 2. Create the Game Assets
Create the game assets, such as the spaceship, enemies, and background images.

### 3. Implement Game Logic
Write the game logic using JavaScript, including handling user input, updating the game state, and checking for collisions.

### 4. Add Scoring and Game Over Screen
Implement scoring and a game over screen that displays the player's score.

### 5. Test and Debug the Game
Test the game, fix any bugs, and ensure it runs smoothly on different browsers and devices.


## Main Features
Features will be added soon


## Sample Code
```javascript
// Example code snippet
function create() {
  // Create the spaceship sprite
  this.spaceship = this.add.sprite(100, 100, 'spaceship');
}
```


## Getting Started
Instructions will be added soon

## Resources
- [Phaser Official Documentation](https://phaser.io/docs/) (documentation)
- [Phaser Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlBwrmiRkjI) (video)
- [JavaScript and HTML/CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/) (tutorial)


## AI Coding Prompts

Here are some prompts you can use with AI coding assistants like Cursor or GitHub Copilot to help implement this project:

### Prompt 1
```
Create a new Phaser game and set up the game configuration. Define the game's title, width, and height. Then, create a new scene and define the 'create' method where we can add the spaceship sprite.
```

### Prompt 2
```
Implement the core game functionality by adding the spaceship's movement and shooting mechanics. Use Phaser's built-in input handling to detect user input and update the spaceship's position accordingly. Also, add a basic enemy AI to patrol a specific area of the game world.
```

### Prompt 3
```
Add a scoring system and a game over screen. Use Phaser's built-in physics engine to detect collisions between the spaceship and enemies. When an enemy is hit, increment the score and remove the enemy from the game world. When the score reaches a certain threshold, trigger the game over screen.
```


Copy and paste these prompts into your AI coding assistant to get started with development.
